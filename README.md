LitmusClient
============

LitmusClient is a c# wrapper for Litmus's Customer API.  It is currently under development.  It uses RestSharp (https://github.com/restsharp/RestSharp) to wrap Litmus's REST API.

Currently it's awaiting resolution of a small RestSharp issue before it could be used in a live application (https://github.com/restsharp/RestSharp/issues/269).

You will need your own Litmus account to use this library which you can get here:  http://litmus.com/pricing
